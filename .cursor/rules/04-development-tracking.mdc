# Development Tracking Guidelines

## Project Planning
The project plan is maintained in @.notes/plan.md. When working on the project:
- Reference the project phases and goals
- Update task status ([ ] to [x]) as items are completed
- Add new tasks as they are identified
- Keep technical requirements up to date
- Document timeline changes

## Development Notes
Development progress is tracked in @.notes/dev.md When implementing features or making changes:

### Status Updates
- Keep "Current Development Status" section updated
- Add dated entries in the Development Log
- Document all technical decisions with rationales

### Implementation Documentation
- Record important implementation details
- Document challenges and their solutions
- Note any deviations from initial plans
- Track performance optimizations
- Document security considerations

### Task Management
- Maintain the TODO list with current tasks
- Update Questions & Considerations as needed
- Document integration details with external services
- Keep testing notes current

## Guidelines for Updates
1. Always date new entries in the development log
2. Link related entries between plan.md and dev.md
3. Keep security-sensitive information in appropriate secure storage
4. Update debugging notes with reproducible steps
5. Document all API integrations thoroughly

## Review Process
- Regularly review and update both documents
- Ensure alignment between plan and implementation
- Track technical debt and future improvements
- Document lessons learned and best practices
- Keep deployment notes current

## Note Format
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Link to relevant documentation
- Add timestamps for important updates
- Tag urgent or blocking issues appropriately
