# Build and Run Guidelines

1. Before running the application:
   - Always build first to check for errors
   - Use `npm run build` Wor equivalent command
   - Check build output for errors and warnings
   - Fix any build errors before proceeding

2. Running the application:
   - DO NOT automatically start the application
   - Instead, provide the command for the user to run
   - Example: "To start the application, please run: `npm run dev`"
   - Include any necessary environment setup instructions

3. Build errors:
   - When build errors occur:
     - Show the error message
     - Explain the likely cause
     - Suggest fixes
     - Let the user decide how to proceed

4. Development workflow:
   - Build first: `npm run build`
   - Fix any build errors
   - Provide start command to user
   - Let user control when to start the application
